# Roxanne-Form-Validation
Form Validation Project A responsive form that validates user input in real-time using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It checks for empty fields, valid email formats, password strength, and confirmation match. This project highlights my skills in JavaScript logic and improving user interaction through dynamic feedback.
